## Abstract
This study explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in automating the generation of physics exercises. By integrating principles from Bloom's Taxonomy, the research develops a prompt framework named BPE (Bloom's Physics Exercises) to enhance the quality and relevance of automatically generated questions. The BPE framework addresses challenges such as controlling question difficulty, assessing cognitive depth, and managing computational aspects. Key components of the framework include 'Action', 'Purpose', 'Example', 'Role', and 'Excluded Content', which together guide the LLM to produce exercises that are pedagogically sound and tailored to educational needs. This approach aims to reduce teacher workload, diversify student learning experiences, and improve the overall educational efficacy of AI-assisted learning environments.

## Introduction
In the field of school physics education, automatic question generation by LLM is a crucial aspect of AI-enhanced education. Traditional question design relies heavily on teachers' expertise, curricula, and subjective preferences, making it a complex and potentially biased task.

The iFLYTEK Spark Large Model (iFSLM), designed by iFLYTEK Corporation as a counterpart to ChatGPT, is a powerful LLM that boasts robust learning capabilities and high-speed operational efficiency. It is capable of comprehending and mimicking human methods of crafting examination questions, generating physics questions that align with educational requirements. This not only alleviates the workload of teachers but also offers students a more diverse and personalized learning experience, thereby fostering their holistic development.

## Method
### Description of Bloom's Taxonomy
Bloom's Taxonomy, proposed in the 20th century, systematically categorizes educational goals into three domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. Within the cognitive domain, Bloom further refines it into six progressively ordered levels of objectives: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, create. This hierarchical framework provides a clear and precise delineation of educational goals within the cognitive realm, articulated through specific competency-level criteria, thereby laying a solid foundation for the theory's widespread application in educational practice.

### Evaluation Indicators
After extensive literature review and in-depth discussions with experts and scholars in related fields, six detailed statements were devised, utilizing a Five-point Likert Scale to collect respondents' subjective perceptions. This approach aims to better differentiate six distinct levels of physics problem-solving exercises.

## Conclusion
Through our research, we have analyzed the currently popular prompt frameworks and ultimately summarized and designed the BPE framework, which comprises five key terms: “Action”, “Purpose”, “Example”, “Role”, and “Excluded Content”. These elements comprehensively describe the specific context and requirements for generating topics, while "Example" provides LLM with learning content, enabling the results to be more akin to real-world scenarios and fully leveraging the powerful capabilities of machine learning.
